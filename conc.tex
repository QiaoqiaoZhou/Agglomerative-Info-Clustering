%To address the concern of entropy estimation and computational complexity, 
We have described an
agglomerative info-clustering approach that merges smaller clusters into larger clusters
successively. In particular, it reveals a fundamental property of the MMI, namely, that the MMI can be computed by
maximizing the normalized total correlation successively over subsets of agglomerated RVs. While
faster info-clustering algorithms are possible as in the case of the Markov tree
model~\cite{chan16cluster} and the graphical model~\cite{chan17ita,kolmogorov10}, the current
agglomerative approach gives the fastest algorithm without assuming any special source models. To
further improve the performance, heuristics such as \cite{jegelka2011fast} may be adapted to improve
the minimum norm base algorithm.
